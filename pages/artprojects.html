            <h4>One of my main passions outside of my academic work is art. I started drawing when I was little and have not stopped since. Some of my main inspirations come from cartoons and shows I have watched (learn more about my inspirations <a href="../pages/inspirations.html">here</a>) I am currently focusing on getting a comic I have been working on onto the internet for you guys to see, so watch out for that!</h4>

            <p>I am currently working on a comic based slightly on Greek and Roman mythology. Slide 1 features some of the main characters of this comic in dynamic poses and outfits. Oftentimes, I draw these collages to get a better idea of how I want characters to look aesthetically and objectively.</p>
            <p>Besides the comic, I am also working on my art skills, particularly my ability to paint and color. The second slide, which features Link from Breath of the Wild, is part of my attempt to do so. Breath of the Wild is interesting from a game development perspective because it uses cel shading rather than realistic shading, which gives it a cartoon-y effect. I wanted to replicate this in my artwork.</p>
            <p>I am also working on the composition of my art pieces. The last slide depicts the time when I got a hairbrush stuck in my hair and all of my friends had to help me get it out. I thought this was fun inspiration for a chaotic artwork where I could practice composition as well as coloring and environmental shading.</p>

            <p>These are some of my completed art pieces. All of my art is done digitally, though I have considered trying traditional methods in the past.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Project 1: Witch. My first completed art piece was done for Halloween. I was really inspired by the anime Little Witch Academia and thought that Halloween would be the perfect opportunity to show my love for the convent lifestyle. It was a real challenge to color everything, especially her clothes, but I had a fun time.</li>
                <li>Project 2: Short Comic. This is a snippet of the comic I'm currently working on. Depicted is two of the main characters realizing that another one of the characters is missing after a turbulent boat ride. I played around with angles and conveying emotions in this piece.</li>
                <li>Project 3: Flower. This last piece was part of a series where I tried around some bold colors. The process taught me a lot about saturation and contrast, which are a lot easier to understand with colors that are really "out there".</li>
